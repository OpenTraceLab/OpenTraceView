== Overview

OpenTraceView is a graphical frontend for the OpenTraceCapture and OpenTraceDecode libraries, permitting
access to a wide range of devices and protocol decoders to let you record, analyze, process
and export analog and logic data.

OpenTraceView supports various hardware devices including logic analyzers, oscilloscopes, and mixed-signal devices. Compatible hardware includes:

- FX2-based logic analyzers and oscilloscopes
- SCPI-compatible oscilloscopes (Rigol, LeCroy, Yokogawa, etc.)
- Various USB logic analyzers
- Mixed-signal devices

For best results, quality probe hooks and proper grounding are recommended.

The OpenTraceView user interface is geared towards navigation and analysis of captured waveforms, so
the most space is by default used up by the main trace view. From here, you can access the most
often used features.

Before we dive deeper into how to accomplish things, let's make OpenTraceView available on your
system first.
