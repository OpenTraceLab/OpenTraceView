== Installation

OpenTraceView can be run on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. Binary packages and installers may be available for your platform.

=== Linux

On Linux, the usual way to install OpenTraceView is to build from source or install packages if available from your distribution.

==== Building from Source

To build OpenTraceView from source:

[listing, subs="normal"]
# Install dependencies (Qt6, glib, glibmm, boost, OpenTraceCapture, OpenTraceDecode)
git clone <repository-url>
cd OpenTraceView
meson setup build --buildtype=release
meson compile -C build
meson install -C build

No system files are changed during development builds. Configuration is stored in ~/.config/opentrace.
./sigrok-cross-linux
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/sr/lib
~/sr/bin/opentraceview

No system files are changed, so if you decide that you no longer want to use OpenTraceView, simply
delete the ~/sr directory. If you also want the stored settings gone, delete ~/.config/sigrok
as well.

[WARNING]
--
If you don't install the OpenTraceView distro packages (as is the case when using the AppImage or building
from source), OpenTraceView will not be able to access USB and serial port devices unless it's run as root.
Since programs shouldn't be run as root unless absolutely necessary, we provide udev configuration files
that allows OpenTraceView access to those devices without being root.

Here's how you install them:

==== Device Permissions

On Linux, you may need to set up udev rules for your hardware devices. Check your device documentation for the appropriate udev rules.

=== Windows

Binary installers for Windows may be available. After installation, certain devices may require driver changes using tools like Zadig to work with OpenTraceView. Most devices work with the WinUSB driver.

=== Mac OS X

Binary installers for Mac OS X may be available. Configuration is stored in ~/Library/Preferences/opentraceview.plist.
